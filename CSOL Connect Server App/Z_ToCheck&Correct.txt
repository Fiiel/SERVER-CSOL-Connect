##TO CHECK & CORRECT##
========================================
1. PC_Add.cs [Code] does not have further database table validation.
- Like, if this entry from the database already exist... It should reject if the entry to be added has the same credentials as that entry from the database

2. In Mapping.cs, the PC Labels are not directly under the middle of the PC Icons.
- My OCD hurts.

5. There is a white space at the right side of the PC Icons added in the Mapping Panel
- This results to a space in the right side of the Mapping Panel, when moving the PC Icon there

6. Sometimes to access the PC_Info.cs Form of the PCs in the panel, I need to click 2-3 times.
- This hurts the user experience.

7. Login Form automatically chooses the Password Textbox for some reason.

8. Some Forms can be resizable by hovering mouse pointer to the edge of the form

9. Some Forms do not start at the Center Screen 

10. Remove unnecessary reference or directives or namespaces.

11. Some forms do not have logo in the title of their window form.


##DONE##
3. Moving the PC in the panel, count as a 'click'.
- Therefore, this opens their PC_Info.cs form.

4. After newly adding PC in the panel, clicking it does not open its PC_Info.cs form
- I need to exit and open the app again to access it.

*The LAN port script should be in the Server Side
